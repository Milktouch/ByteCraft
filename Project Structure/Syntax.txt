variables
variables are declared as follows:
<variable name> = <value>
examples:
var = 5
var2 = "hello"
var3 = 5.5
var4 = true

operations
operations are used the following way:
<operation name> <parameter1>, <parameter2>, <parameter3>, ...
examples:
write "hello"
add 5, 5

every operation returns a value, the value is automatically stored in a variable called "Result"
you can use another variable to permanently store the result
examples:
add 5, 5
var = Result // var will be 10
